html-outliner-spec
===============

The purpose of this repository was to try to understand HTML's outline
algorithm as it was defined by the W3C's HTML specification.

1. Read the specification.
2. Extract the outliner's processing steps.
3. Translate these steps into pseudocode.
4. Try to implement the pseudocode and fail.

Even though it might seem straight forward to take the specification and
simply implement it, that task is doomed to fail due to several issues.

( Archived until there is an error-free alternative ... )
