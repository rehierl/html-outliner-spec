TODO - suggest to change the following aspects in HTML's specification

* [W3C, HTML 5.2, Editor's Draft, 3 May 2017](https://w3c.github.io/html)

### [sectioning root](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#sectioning-roots)

* the definition of sectioning roots (SR) is quite lost inside [4.3.9 Headings and sections](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#headings-and-sections)
* similar to [3.2.4.2.3. sectioning content](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#sectioning-content), SRs should get their own definition inside [3.2.4 Content models](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#content-models)

### [article element](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#the-article-element)

* Categories: Flow content **, but with no main element descendants**
* "but with no main" probably should be placed inside the "Content model" part
* see [aside element](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#elementdef-aside)

### [main element](https://w3c.github.io/html/grouping-content.html#elementdef-main)

* 2nd paragraph after the first note
* if **greater** than one main element is present
  -> if **more** than one main element is present
