TODO - suggest to change the following aspects in HTML's specification

* [W3C, HTML 5.2, Editor's Draft, 3 May 2017](https://w3c.github.io/html)

### [sectioning root](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#sectioning-roots)

* the definition of sectioning roots (SR) is quite lost inside [4.3.9 Headings and sections](https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#headings-and-sections)
* similar to [3.2.4.2.3. sectioning content](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#sectioning-content),
SRs should get their own definition inside [3.2.4 Content models](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#content-models)
